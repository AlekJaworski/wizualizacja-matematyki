options:
  - "$\dim_F K$ as a vector space over $F$"
  - "The number of elements in $K$"
  - "The degree of the minimal polynomial of $K$"
  - "$|K| / |F|$"
correct: 0
hint: The degree [K:F] is the dimension of K as a vector space over F. For example [ℂ:ℝ] = 2 (basis {1, i}), [ℝ:ℚ] = ∞.

The degree of a field extension $K/F$, written $[K:F]$, is:
