options:
  - "The smallest field extension of $F$ over which $f$ splits into linear factors"
  - "Any field containing $F$"
  - "The field $F$ itself if $f$ is irreducible"
  - "The field generated by the coefficients of $f$"
correct: 0
hint: The splitting field of f over F is F(α₁,...,αₙ) where α₁,...,αₙ are all roots of f. It is the smallest extension where f factors completely into linear factors.
