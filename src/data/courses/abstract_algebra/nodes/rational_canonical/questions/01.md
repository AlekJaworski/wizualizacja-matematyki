options:
  - "M ≅ R/(d₁) ⊕ ... ⊕ R/(dₖ) where d₁ | d₂ | ... | dₖ"
  - "Each invariant factor dᵢ divides the next"
  - "The decomposition is unique"
  - "All of the above"
correct: 3
hint: Rational canonical form gives invariant factors—each cyclic summand's ideal contains the next.

The rational canonical form states that a finitely generated module over F[x] decomposes as:
