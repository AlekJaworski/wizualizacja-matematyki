options:
  - "$n_p \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$ and $n_p \mid m$"
  - "$n_p \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$ and $n_p \mid |G|$"
  - "$n_p = 1$ always"
  - "$n_p \mid p^n$"
correct: 0
hint: Sylow's third theorem: nₚ ≡ 1 (mod p) and nₚ divides m (the p'-part of |G|). This often forces nₚ = 1, making the Sylow subgroup normal and unique.

Sylow's Third Theorem constrains the number $n_p$ of Sylow $p$-subgroups by:
