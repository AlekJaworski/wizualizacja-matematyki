options:
  - "All Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$ are conjugate to each other"
  - "There is exactly one Sylow $p$-subgroup"
  - "Sylow $p$-subgroups are always normal"
  - "All subgroups of the same order are Sylow subgroups"
correct: 0
hint: Sylow's second theorem: any two Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate. A Sylow p-subgroup is normal iff it is unique (nₚ = 1). Many groups have multiple non-normal Sylow subgroups.
