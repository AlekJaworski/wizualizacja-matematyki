options:
  - "The order of every element divides |G|"
  - "Every divisor of |G| is the order of some element"
  - "G has a subgroup of every order that divides |G|"
  - "All elements of G have the same order"
correct: 0
hint: The order of an element g is |⟨g⟩|, and ⟨g⟩ is a subgroup of G, so by Lagrange |⟨g⟩| divides |G|. The converse (every divisor gives an element) is false in general.
tests:
  subgroups: 1.0

A corollary of Lagrange's theorem for a finite group $G$ is:
