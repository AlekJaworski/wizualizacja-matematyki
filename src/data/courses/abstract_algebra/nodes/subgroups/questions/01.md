options:
  - "H is nonempty and closed under the operation and taking inverses"
  - "H is nonempty and closed under the operation only"
  - "H contains the identity and is closed under the operation"
  - "H is a group under any binary operation"
correct: 0
hint: The one-step subgroup test: H ≤ G iff H ≠ ∅ and for all a,b ∈ H we have ab⁻¹ ∈ H. Equivalently H is nonempty, closed under multiplication, and closed under inverses.
tests:
  subgroups: 1.0

The subgroup test says $H \leq G$ if and only if:
