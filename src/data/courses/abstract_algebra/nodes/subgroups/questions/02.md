options:
  - "The order of H divides the order of G"
  - "The order of G divides the order of H"
  - "H and G must have the same order"
  - "The order of H equals the index of H in G"
correct: 0
hint: Lagrange's theorem: if G is a finite group and H ≤ G, then |H| divides |G|. The index [G:H] = |G|/|H| is the number of cosets.
tests:
  subgroups: 1.0

Lagrange's theorem states that for a finite group $G$ with subgroup $H$:
