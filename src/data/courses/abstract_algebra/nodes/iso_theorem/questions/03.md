options:
  - "Subgroups of $G/N$ correspond bijectively to subgroups of $G$ containing $N$"
  - "Every subgroup of $G$ maps to a subgroup of $G/N$"
  - "$G/N$ has fewer subgroups than $G$"
  - "Normal subgroups of $G/N$ correspond to all subgroups of $G$"
correct: 0
hint: The Correspondence (Lattice) Theorem: there is an order-preserving bijection between subgroups of G/N and subgroups of G that contain N. Normal subgroups correspond to normal subgroups.
