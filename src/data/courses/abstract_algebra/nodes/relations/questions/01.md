options:
  - "It is an equivalence relation"

  - "It is symmetric but not reflexive"
  - "It is transitive but not symmetric"
correct: 0
hint: Check all three properties. The relation 'a ≡ b (mod n)' is reflexive (a-a=0 divisible by n), symmetric, and transitive.

The relation $a \sim b$ on $\mathbb{Z}$ defined by $n \mid (a - b)$ for a fixed $n > 1$ is:
