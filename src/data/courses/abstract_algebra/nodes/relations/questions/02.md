options:
  - "The equivalence classes of ~ partition S"
  - "Every element belongs to exactly two equivalence classes"
  - "Equivalence classes may overlap"
  - "An equivalence class can be empty"
correct: 0
hint: A fundamental theorem: equivalence classes are disjoint (an element belongs to exactly one class) and their union is all of S.

If $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on a set $S$, then:
