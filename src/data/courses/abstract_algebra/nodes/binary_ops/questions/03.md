options:
  - "A binary operation ∗ on S such that for all a,b,c ∈ S: (a∗b)∗c = a∗(b∗c)"
  - "A binary operation ∗ on S such that a∗b = b∗a for all a,b"
  - "A function S → S"
  - "An operation where every element has an inverse"
correct: 0
hint: Associativity is the property (a∗b)∗c = a∗(b∗c). Commutativity (a∗b = b∗a) is a separate, stronger condition not required for a semigroup.

Associativity of a binary operation ∗ on S means:
