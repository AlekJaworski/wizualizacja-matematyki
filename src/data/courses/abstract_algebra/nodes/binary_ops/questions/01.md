options:
  - "It is a semigroup but not a monoid"
  - "It is a monoid"
  - "It is a group"
  - "It is not a semigroup"
correct: 0
hint: Subtraction is associative? Check: (5-3)-1=1, 5-(3-1)=3. Not equal — so subtraction on ℤ is NOT associative; hence not even a semigroup. But the question uses (ℕ, −)... wait, actually subtraction on ℕ isn't even closed. On ℤ: not associative.
