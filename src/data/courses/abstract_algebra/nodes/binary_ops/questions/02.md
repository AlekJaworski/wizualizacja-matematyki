options:
  - "There is exactly one identity element"
  - "There can be two or more identity elements"
  - "An identity element need not be unique"
  - "Identity elements only exist in groups"
correct: 0
hint: Suppose e and e' are both identities. Then e = e·e' = e'. The argument forces uniqueness in any algebraic structure with an associative operation.
