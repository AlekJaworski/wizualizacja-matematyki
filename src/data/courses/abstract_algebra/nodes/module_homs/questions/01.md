options:
  - "φ(r·m) = r·φ(m) for all r ∈ R, m ∈ M"
  - "φ(m + n) = φ(m) + φ(n) and φ(r·m) = r·φ(m)"
  - "φ is bijective and respects scalar multiplication"
  - "φ(0) = 0 and φ(-m) = -φ(m)"
correct: 1
hint: A module homomorphism must be a group homomorphism (additive) AND respect scalar multiplication. Both conditions are needed.
