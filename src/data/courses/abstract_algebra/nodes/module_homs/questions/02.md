options:
  - "ker(φ) = {m ∈ M : φ(m) = 0} is a submodule of M"
  - "im(φ) is a submodule of N"
  - "Both the kernel and image are submodules"
  - "Neither kernel nor image need be submodules"
correct: 2
hint: Just like with group homomorphisms, the kernel is the preimage of {0}, and the image is the set of all outputs—both are submodules.
