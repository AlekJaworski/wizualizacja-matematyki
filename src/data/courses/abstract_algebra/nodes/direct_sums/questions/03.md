options:
  - "Rⁿ ≅ R ⊕ R ⊕ ... ⊕ R (n copies)"
  - "Rⁿ is isomorphic to the set of column vectors of length n"
  - "Both descriptions are correct"
  - "Rⁿ is only defined for fields"
correct: 2
hint: Rⁿ is the n-dimensional free module over R, which is the direct sum of n copies of R. It can also be viewed as column vectors.
