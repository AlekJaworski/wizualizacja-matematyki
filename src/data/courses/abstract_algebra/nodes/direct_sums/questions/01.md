options:
  - "M₁ ⊕ M₂ = {(m₁, m₂) : m₁ ∈ M₁, m₂ ∈ M₂} with componentwise operations"
  - "M₁ × M₂ = pairs with coordinate-wise addition and scalar multiplication"
  - "Both descriptions describe the same object"
  - "Direct sum and direct product are different for two modules"
correct: 2
hint: For finitely many modules, direct sum and direct product coincide. The notation M₁ ⊕ M₂ or M₁ × M₂ both work.
