options:
  - "A field"
  - "An integral domain"
  - "A ring with zero divisors"
  - "Always the zero ring"
correct: 0
hint: R/M is a field iff M is maximal. This is a key theorem: the quotient by a maximal ideal has no proper nontrivial ideals, which for commutative rings with 1 is equivalent to being a field.
tests:
  ideals: 1.0

If $M$ is a maximal ideal of a commutative ring $R$, then $R/M$ is:
