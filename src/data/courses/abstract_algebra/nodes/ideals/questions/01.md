options:
  - "A subring $I$ such that $rI \subseteq I$ and $Ir \subseteq I$ for all $r \in R$"
  - "Any subring of $R$"
  - "A subring closed under multiplication"
  - "A subset closed under addition only"
correct: 0
hint: An ideal absorbs multiplication from R on both sides. This is stronger than being a subring. Left ideal: rI ⊆ I. Right ideal: Ir ⊆ I. Two-sided ideal: both.
tests:
  ideals: 1.0

A two-sided ideal $I$ of a ring $R$ is:
