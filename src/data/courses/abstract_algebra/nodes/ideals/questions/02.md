options:
  - "An ideal $M$ such that no ideal $I$ satisfies $M \subsetneq I \subsetneq R$"
  - "An ideal generated by a prime element"
  - "An ideal equal to $R$ itself"
  - "An ideal with exactly one element"
correct: 0
hint: M is maximal if it is proper (M ≠ R) and maximal among proper ideals. Equivalently R/M is a field. Maximal ideals are always prime, but not vice versa.
