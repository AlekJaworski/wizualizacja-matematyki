options:
  - "$(\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}, \times)$"
  - "$(\mathbb{R}, \times)$"
  - "$(\mathbb{N}, +)$"
  - "$(\mathbb{Z}, \times)$"
correct: 0
hint: (ℝ\{0}, ×): closed ✓, associative ✓, identity 1 ✓, inverses (1/x) ✓. (ℝ,×) fails because 0 has no inverse. (ℕ,+) has no inverses. (ℤ,×) has no inverses except ±1.
