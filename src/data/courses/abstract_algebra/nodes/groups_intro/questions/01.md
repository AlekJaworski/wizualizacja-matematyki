options:
  - "Closure, associativity, identity, inverses"
  - "Closure, commutativity, identity, inverses"
  - "Closure, associativity, commutativity, identity"
  - "Associativity, identity, inverses (closure is automatic)"
correct: 0
hint: The four group axioms are: (1) closure, (2) associativity, (3) identity element, (4) inverses. Commutativity is NOT required — that makes an abelian group.
