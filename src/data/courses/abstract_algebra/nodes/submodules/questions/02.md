options:
  - "The set of even integers 2ℤ as a ℤ-module"
  - "The set {0} (zero submodule)"
  - "The whole module M"
  - "Any subset of M containing 0"
correct: 0
hint: {0} and M are always submodules. For ℤ acting on ℤ, 2ℤ is closed under addition and multiplication by integers.
tests:
  submodules: 1.0
