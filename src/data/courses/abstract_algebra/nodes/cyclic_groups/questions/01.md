options:
  - "Every cyclic group is abelian"
  - "Every abelian group is cyclic"
  - "Cyclic groups must be finite"
  - "The only cyclic group is $\mathbb{Z}$"
correct: 0
hint: If G = ⟨g⟩ then any two elements gᵐ and gⁿ commute: gᵐgⁿ = gᵐ⁺ⁿ = gⁿgᵐ. So every cyclic group is abelian. The converse fails: ℤ₂×ℤ₂ is abelian but not cyclic.
tests:
  cyclic_groups: 1.0

Which statement about cyclic groups is always true?
