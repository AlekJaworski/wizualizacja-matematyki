options:
  - "Every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic"
  - "Cyclic groups have no proper subgroups"
  - "A cyclic group can have non-cyclic subgroups"
  - "The only subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}$ is $\mathbb{Z}$ itself"
correct: 0
hint: If G = ⟨g⟩ is cyclic, any subgroup H consists of powers of g, so H = ⟨gᵏ⟩ for some k — cyclic. For ℤ, every subgroup is nℤ = ⟨n⟩ for some n ≥ 0.
