options:
  - "Verify P(1) and show P(k) ⟹ P(k+1)"
  - "Verify P(1) only"
  - "Show P(k+1) ⟹ P(k) for all k"
  - "Verify P(n) for all n ≤ 10, then conclude"
correct: 0
hint: Weak induction requires a base case (usually n=1) plus an inductive step that proves the next case from the current one.

To prove a statement $P(n)$ for all $n \geq 1$ by weak mathematical induction, you must:
