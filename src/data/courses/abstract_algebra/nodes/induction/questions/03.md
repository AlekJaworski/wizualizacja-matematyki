options:
  - "Strong induction assumes P(1), …, P(k) to prove P(k+1)"
  - "Strong induction only needs the base case P(0)"
  - "Strong induction is weaker than ordinary induction"
  - "Strong induction cannot prove statements about integers"
correct: 0
hint: In strong induction the inductive hypothesis is that P(j) holds for ALL j ≤ k, not just j = k. This makes it more powerful for some proofs (e.g. prime factorisation).
tests:
  induction: 1.0
