options:
  - "M ⊗_R F ≅ Fⁿ where F is a splitting field"
  - "Over an algebraically closed field"
  - "When all eigenvalues are in the field"
  - "When the characteristic polynomial splits"
correct: 1
hint: Jordan normal form exists when the field contains all eigenvalues—that's what "algebraically closed" means.
