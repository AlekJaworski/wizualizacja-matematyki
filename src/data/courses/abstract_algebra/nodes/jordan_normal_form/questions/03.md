options:
  - "The size of the largest Jordan block for λ equals the exponent of (x-λ) in the minimal polynomial"
  - "The algebraic multiplicity of λ equals the sum of sizes of all λ blocks"
  - "The geometric multiplicity equals the number of λ blocks"
  - "All of the above"
correct: 3
hint: These three facts characterize the Jordan blocks.
