options:
  - "A nonzero element $a$ such that $ab = 0$ for some nonzero $b$"
  - "An element with no multiplicative inverse"
  - "The additive identity element"
  - "An element equal to its own square"
correct: 0
hint: a is a zero divisor if a ≠ 0 and there exists b ≠ 0 with ab = 0 (or ba = 0). Example: in ℤ₆, the element 2 is a zero divisor because 2·3 = 6 ≡ 0.
