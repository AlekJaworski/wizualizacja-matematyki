options:
  - "$(R, +)$ is an abelian group, $\cdot$ is associative, and $\cdot$ distributes over $+$"
  - "$(R, +)$ is a group and $(R, \cdot)$ is a group"
  - "$(R, +)$ is abelian and $(R, \cdot)$ is abelian"
  - "Every element has a multiplicative inverse"
correct: 0
hint: A ring needs: (R,+) abelian group, (R,·) associative (semigroup), and both distributive laws. Multiplication need not be commutative, and inverses are not required.
