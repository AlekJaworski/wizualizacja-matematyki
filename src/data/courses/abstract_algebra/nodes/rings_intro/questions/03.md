options:
  - "The smallest positive integer $n$ such that $n \cdot 1 = 0$, or $0$ if no such $n$ exists"
  - "The number of elements in the ring"
  - "The largest prime dividing $|R|$"
  - "The additive order of the identity element always"
correct: 0
hint: char(R) = the additive order of 1 if it is finite, or 0 if 1 has infinite additive order. For ℤₙ, char = n. For ℤ, ℚ, ℝ, char = 0.
