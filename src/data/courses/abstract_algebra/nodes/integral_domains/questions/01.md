options:
  - "A commutative ring with unity and no zero divisors"
  - "Any commutative ring"
  - "A ring in which every nonzero element has an inverse"
  - "A ring with a unique maximal ideal"
correct: 0
hint: Integral domain = commutative + unity + no zero divisors. A field is stronger: every nonzero element has an inverse. ℤ is an integral domain but not a field.
