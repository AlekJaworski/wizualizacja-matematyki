options:
  - "A commutative ring with unity in which every nonzero element is a unit"
  - "A ring with no zero divisors"
  - "Any integral domain"
  - "A ring in which $1 = 0$"
correct: 0
hint: A field is a commutative ring with 1 ≠ 0 where every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse. Every field is an integral domain, but not vice versa (ℤ is not a field).
