options:
  - "The multiplicative group of a finite field is cyclic"
  - "Every finite field has prime order"
  - "There are infinitely many non-isomorphic fields of order $p^2$"
  - "Finite fields of the same order may be non-isomorphic"
correct: 0
hint: For GF(pⁿ), the multiplicative group GF(pⁿ)* has order pⁿ-1 and is cyclic (generated by a primitive element). Also: finite fields of the same order are unique up to isomorphism.

Which is true about finite fields (Galois fields)?
