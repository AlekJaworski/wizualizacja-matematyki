options:
  - "$\mathbb{Z}_p$ for prime $p$"
  - "$\mathbb{Z}_n$ for any $n > 1$"
  - "$\mathbb{Z}_4$"
  - "$\mathbb{Z}_6$"
correct: 0
hint: ℤₙ is a field iff n is prime. If n is composite, say n = ab with 1 < a,b < n, then a and b are zero divisors (a·b ≡ 0 mod n) so ℤₙ is not even an integral domain.
