options:
  - "A primary ideal I has the property: if ab ∈ I and a ∉ I, then bⁿ ∈ I for some n"
  - "A prime power pⁿ is primary in ℤ"
  - "Primary decomposition requires prime powers"
  - "Primary ideals are always maximal"
correct: 0
hint: Primary ideals are the building blocks: if ab ∈ I and a ∉ I, then some power of b is in I.
