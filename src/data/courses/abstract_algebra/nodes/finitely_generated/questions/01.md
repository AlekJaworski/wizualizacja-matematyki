options:
  - "M = Rm₁ + Rm₂ + ... + Rmₙ for some m₁,...,mₙ ∈ M"
  - "M has a finite generating set"
  - "There exists a surjective R-linear map Rⁿ → M"
  - "All of the above are equivalent"
correct: 3
hint: A module is finitely generated iff it can be generated by finitely many elements, equivalently there's a surjection from Rⁿ.
