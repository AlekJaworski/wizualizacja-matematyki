options:
  - "Every projective module is a direct summand of a free module"
  - "Every free module is projective"
  - "Projective modules are precisely those that are free"
  - "Projective modules do not exist over ℤ"
correct: 1
hint: Free ⇒ projective: if M is free with basis, any surjection from a free module to M splits.
tests:
  free_modules: 1.0
  finitely_generated: 0.25
