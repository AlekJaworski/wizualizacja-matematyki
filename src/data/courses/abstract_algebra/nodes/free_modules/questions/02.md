options:
  - "Every vector space is a free module"
  - "Every abelian group is a free ℤ-module"
  - "ℤ/2ℤ is a free ℤ-module"
  - "Free modules over ℤ are exactly ℤⁿ"
correct: 0
hint: Vector spaces over fields always have a basis. But ℤ-modules (abelian groups) need not be free—ℤ/2ℤ has no basis.
tests:
  free_modules: 1.0
  modules_intro: 0.25
