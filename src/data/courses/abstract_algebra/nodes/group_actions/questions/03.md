options:
  - "Conjugacy classes of $G$"
  - "Left cosets of $G$"
  - "Normal subgroups of $G$"
  - "Elements of order 2"
correct: 0
hint: When G acts on itself by conjugation g·x = gxg⁻¹, the orbits are exactly the conjugacy classes {gxg⁻¹ : g ∈ G}. The class equation counts elements via these orbits.
