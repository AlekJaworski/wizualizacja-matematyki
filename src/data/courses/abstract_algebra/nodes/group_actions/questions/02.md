options:
  - "Every group $G$ embeds into the symmetric group $S_{|G|}$"
  - "Every finite group is isomorphic to $S_n$ for some $n$"
  - "Every group is abelian"
  - "Every group acts trivially on itself"
correct: 0
hint: Cayley's theorem: the left-multiplication action of G on itself gives an injective homomorphism G → Sym(G) ≅ S_{|G|}. So every group is isomorphic to a subgroup of some symmetric group.
