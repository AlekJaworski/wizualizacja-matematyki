options:
  - "$gNg^{-1} = N$ for all $g \in G$"
  - "$gN = g$ for all $g \in G$"
  - "$N$ is closed under conjugation by elements of $N$"
  - "$N$ commutes with itself"
correct: 0
hint: N ⊴ G iff N is closed under conjugation by any element of G: for all g∈G and n∈N, gng⁻¹ ∈ N. This is equivalent to gNg⁻¹ = N.
