options:
  - "A group with no proper nontrivial normal subgroups"
  - "A group with no subgroups at all"
  - "A cyclic group of prime order"
  - "An abelian group"
correct: 0
hint: A simple group has exactly two normal subgroups: {e} and G itself. ℤₚ (p prime) is simple. Non-abelian examples: A₅ (order 60), the first non-abelian simple group.
