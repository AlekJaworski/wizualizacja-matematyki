options:
  - "Every subgroup of an abelian group is normal"
  - "Every normal subgroup is abelian"
  - "Normal subgroups must have index 2"
  - "The trivial subgroup is never normal"
correct: 0
hint: If G is abelian then gH = Hg trivially for any H ≤ G (since gh = hg). So every subgroup of an abelian group is automatically normal.

Which statement about normal subgroups is correct?
