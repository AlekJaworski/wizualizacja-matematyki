options:
  - "They partition $G$ into equal-sized pieces"
  - "They form a group under coset multiplication"
  - "Left cosets and right cosets are always equal"
  - "A coset is always a subgroup"
correct: 0
hint: The cosets of H in G partition G (each element belongs to exactly one coset) and all cosets have the same size |H|. They form a group only if H is normal.
tests:
  cosets: 1.0

The left cosets of a subgroup $H$ in a group $G$:
