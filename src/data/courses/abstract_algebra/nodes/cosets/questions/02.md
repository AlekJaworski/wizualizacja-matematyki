options:
  - "$gN = Ng$ for all $g \in G$"
  - "$N$ is abelian"
  - "Every element of $N$ commutes with every element of $G$"
  - "$N$ has index 2 in $G$"
correct: 0
hint: N ⊴ G means left and right cosets coincide: gN = Ng for every g ∈ G. Equivalently, gNg⁻¹ = N for all g. Every subgroup of index 2 is automatically normal.

A subgroup $N$ of $G$ is called normal if:
