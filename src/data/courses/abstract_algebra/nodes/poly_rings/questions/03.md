options:
  - "$a$ is a root of $f$ iff $(x-a)$ divides $f(x)$"
  - "$a$ is a root of $f$ iff $f(x) = x - a$"
  - "Every polynomial of degree $n$ has exactly $n$ roots"
  - "$f$ has a root iff $f$ is irreducible"
correct: 0
hint: Factor theorem: f(a) = 0 ⟺ (x-a) | f(x). This follows from the division algorithm: f(x) = (x-a)q(x) + f(a), so if f(a)=0 then (x-a) | f(x).
