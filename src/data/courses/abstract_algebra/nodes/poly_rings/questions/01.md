options:
  - "There exist unique $q(x), r(x)$ with $f = qg + r$ and $\deg r < \deg g$"
  - "Every polynomial divides every other polynomial"
  - "Division is only possible when $\deg f \geq \deg g$, and the remainder is always 0"
  - "Polynomial division requires $F$ to have characteristic 0"
correct: 0
hint: The division algorithm in F[x]: given f and g ≠ 0 in F[x], there exist unique q (quotient) and r (remainder) with f = qg + r and either r = 0 or deg(r) < deg(g).
