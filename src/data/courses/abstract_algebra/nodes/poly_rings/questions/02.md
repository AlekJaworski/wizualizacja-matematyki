options:
  - "$F[x]/(p(x))$ is a field"
  - "$F[x]/(p(x))$ is the zero ring"
  - "$p(x)$ has a root in $F$"
  - "$F[x]/(p(x))$ has zero divisors"
correct: 0
hint: In F[x], (p(x)) is a maximal ideal iff p(x) is irreducible. Quotient by a maximal ideal in a commutative ring with 1 gives a field.

If $p(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial over a field $F$, then:
