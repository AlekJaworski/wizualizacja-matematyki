options:
  - "An ideal of $R$"
  - "A subring of $R$ but not necessarily an ideal"
  - "Always the zero ideal"
  - "A field"
correct: 0
hint: ker(φ) = {r ∈ R : φ(r) = 0_S}. It is an ideal (not just a subring) because for any r ∈ R and k ∈ ker(φ): φ(rk) = φ(r)·0 = 0, so rk ∈ ker(φ).

The kernel of a ring homomorphism $\varphi: R \to S$ is:
