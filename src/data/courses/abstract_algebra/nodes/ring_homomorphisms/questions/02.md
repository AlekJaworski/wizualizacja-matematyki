options:
  - "$R / \ker(\varphi) \cong \text{im}(\varphi)$"
  - "$R \cong S$ whenever $\varphi$ is a ring homomorphism"
  - "$\ker(\varphi) \cong \text{im}(\varphi)$"
  - "$\text{im}(\varphi)$ is an ideal of $S$"
correct: 0
hint: The First Isomorphism Theorem for rings mirrors the group version: R/ker(φ) ≅ im(φ) via the map r + ker(φ) ↦ φ(r). Note: im(φ) is a subring of S, not necessarily an ideal.
