# Agent Instructions

Before starting any work on this project, read the full progress log:

**[agents/progress.md](agents/progress.md)**

It contains:
- Current project architecture and file map
- Feature completion status
- Per-session log of what was done and what was found
- Known issues and backlog

After completing work in a session, append a new dated entry to `agents/progress.md`
describing what was changed, what decisions were made, and any new issues found.
